## Back v front-end
{sub:1}

## Client v server

- Backend: everything on our computers
- Frontend: everything on the user's computer

## Trust

- Backend: trusted environment
- Frontend: untrusted. Users can see *everything*
- What must backend be wary of?

## Fear gifts from the frontend

- *Never* trust user input
- Validate, restrict, rate-limit, monitor

## Persistence

- Users want same data on mobile, laptop, etc
- Therefore we must persist data somewhere all can access
- Backend required for persistence

## Store, retrieve

- Large amounts of backend work is saving and retrieving data
- Easy with a little; hard with lots
