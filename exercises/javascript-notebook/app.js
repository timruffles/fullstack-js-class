// TODO follow along, writing yourself descriptive console output and comments

// TODO keep asking yourself: could I explain this to someone else? It's the ULTIMATE test of your knowledge


// Here's some example notes

// I can use console to output things
console.log("This is the console - I can output strings here!");

console.log("I can use '%s' to write complex messages easily", "placeholders");

console.log({
  even: "objects",
  can: [
    "be logged",
    "and I can dynamically inspect them in the Javascript console!",
  ],
});
